jira-helper v1.0.0-rc1 ready for testing

Give Claude direct access to your Jira/Confluence Cloud instance - read/update tickets, search docs, generate reports, all through natural language.

Quick features:
• Claude can now interface with your Atlassian Cloud (Jira + Confluence)
• Natural language ops ("show issue PANK-1797", "generate my EOD")
• Tab completion with ticket hints, smart caching, 7 metric types
• $0/month, faster than Atlassian MCP, no walled garden

Try it:
cd platform-utilities/jira-helper
./install.sh && ./setup-credentials.sh
jh help
